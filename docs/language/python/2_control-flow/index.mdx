# Control Flow

## `if` statement

```python title= showLineNumbers
if x < 0:
    print('foo')
elif not x == 0:
    print('bar')
elif x != 1 or x != 2 and x != 3:
    print('baz')
else:
    print('default')
```

### Compare whether 2 object the same

```python title= showLineNumbers
if object_1 is object_2:
  pass
elif object_1 is not object_2:
  pass
elif object_1 is not None:
  pass
```

### Chain comparison

```python title= showLineNumbers
if 1 < 2 == 2 > 0 or SomeObject.hasSomething() :
  pass

# equivalent to 
if 1 < 2 and 2 == 2 and 2 > 0 or SomeObject.hasSomething() :
  pass
```

### Comparing sequences object

```python title= showLineNumbers
"somestring" > "other string"

(1,2,5) >= (5,6,7,8)

["3" ,555] > ["2"]
```

The first two items are compared, and if they are different this determines the outcome of the comparison 

If they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on 


<Admonition type="note" title="note"> 

Comparing two string uses the Unicode code point number to order individual characters.

eg:
- `b > a` because unicode point of `b` is `0062` but `a` is `0061`, so `b` is more than `a`
- `a > B` because unicode point of `a` is `0061` but `B` is `0042`, so `a` is more than `B`

## `pass` statement

`pass` act like empty code block

```python title= showLineNumbers
class MyEmptyClass:
  pass

while True:
  pass

def initlog(*args):
  pass 

if True:
  pass
```
