# `match` statement

```python title= showLineNumbers
def http_error(status):
  match status:
      case 400:
          return "Bad request"
      case 404:
          return "Not found"
      case "this" | "that":
          return "Match either this or that"
      case (0, 0):
        print("Match a tuple 0,0")
      case _:
          return "Something's wrong with the internet"
```

Only the first pattern that matches gets executed

<Admonition type="note" title="note"> 

the variable `_` acts as a wildcard and never fails to match

<Color color="var(--can-not-understand-font-color)"> it can also extract components (sequence elements or object attributes) from the value into variables. </Color>
