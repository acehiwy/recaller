# Virtual environment

A self-contained directory that contains a specific version of Python interpreter and a number of additional packages.

It is used for separation between Python's global module and project's module.

Each project can have its own version of Python interpreter and it own module without interfering other.

```bash title= showLineNumbers
python -m venv <dir path>

# eg
python -m venv /foo
```
