<Color color="var(--can-not-understand-font-color)"> Some Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using python -m module [arg] ..., which executes the source file for module as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line. </Color>

## Passing argument to the script

script argument can be accessed by 

```python title= showLineNumbers
import sys

sys.argv # list of string
```

The length of the list is at least one

when no script and no arguments are given, `sys.argv[0]` is an empty string

When the script name is given as `-` (meaning standard input), `sys.argv[0]` is set to `-`

In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable `_`

```python title= 
2+3
# 5
_ * 2
# 10
_ + 1
# 11
```

<Color color="var(--can-not-understand-font-color)"> When -m module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m module are not consumed by the Python interpreterâ€™s option processing but left in sys.argv for the command or module to handle. </Color>

## <Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)"> Source Code Encoding </Color>

By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8.

declaring other encoding other than default one use special comment should be added as the first line of the file

```python title=foo.py showLineNumbers
# -*- coding: <encoding> -*-
```

```python title=foo.py showLineNumbers
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
```

```bash title=foo.sh showLineNumbers
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
```



where `<encoding>` is one of [codecs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#module-codecs)

## Miscellaneous

Division `/` always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result you can use the `//` operator;

```python title=
1273/3
# 424.3333333333333
1273//3
# 424
```

Simple assignment in Python never copies data
```python title= showLineNumbers
var1 = "foo"
var2 = "foo"
var1 == var2
# True
id(var1) == id(var2)
# True
```

`print()` accept `end=` argument for specifying end of the line characters
```python title= showLineNumbers
print("foo", end="something not new line")
```
