# Packages and Crates

## Crate

A crate is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time.

Crates can contain modules

[//]: # "and the modules may be defined in other files that get compiled with the crate"

A crate can come in one of two forms:

- a binary crate
- a library crate.

### Binary crate

Binary crates are programs you can <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> compile to an executable </Color> that you can run.

It must have `main` function.

### Library crate

Library crates don’t have a `main` function, and they <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> don’t compile to an executable </Color>.

Instead, they define functionality <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> intended to be shared </Color> with multiple projects.

The crate root is a file that the Rust compiler starts compliing code from and makes up the root module of your crate.

## Packages

A package is a <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> bundle of one or more crates </Color> (Binary / Library crate) that provides a set of functionality.

A package contains a `Cargo.toml` file that describes how to build those crates.

`cargo` command line is a package that contains binary crate for CLI and a library crate that binary crate depends on

<Admonition type="caution" title="???">

A package can contain as many binary crates as you like, but at most only one library crate.

</Admonition>

`src/main.rs` is the crate root of a binary crate.

`src/lib.rs` is the crate root of a library crate.

A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the `src/bin` directory: each file will be a separate binary crate.
