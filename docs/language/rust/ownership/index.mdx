# Ownership

A set of rules that the compiler checks.It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.

## Stack and Heap

Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> at runtime </Color>, but they are structured in different ways.

All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size.

Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.

## Ownership Rules

- Each value in Rust has an owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

&#8203;<Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)"> The types covered previously are of a known size, can be stored on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over
and can be quickly copied as an instance if another part of code needs to use it in a different scope. </Color>

## `String` type

```rust title= showLineNumbers
let mut s = String::from("hello");

s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

println!("{}", s); // This will print `hello, world!`
```

`String` type is a mutable growable text

### `String` under cover

![string in memory](../assets/string-in-memory.svg)
A String is made up of three parts

On the left:

- a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string,
- a length
- a capacity.

This group of data is <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> stored on the stack </Color>.

On the right is the memory <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> on the heap </Color> that <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> holds the contents </Color>.

## Memory and Allocation

In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> the text </Color> <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> is hardcoded directly into the final executable </Color>.

However, in order to create `String` we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap (unknown at compile time) to hold the contents.

This means:

- The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> runtime </Color>.
- We need a way of returning this memory (free memory) back to the allocator when we're done with our `String`.

When a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically calls a special `drop` function and <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> cleans up the heap memory for that variable </Color>.

```rust title= showLineNumbers
{
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                    // longer valid
```

## Variables and Data Interacting with Move

When copying known-size value, the value can be copied and push to the stack

```rust title= showLineNumbers
let x = 5;
let y = x;
// two `5` value are pushed onto the stack
```

But copying unknown-size create a stack of its metadata and pointer point to the content location.

```rust title= showLineNumbers
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

![same unknown size value](../assets/same-unknown-size-value.svg)

When `s1` and `s2` go out of scope, Rust need to free the memory that stored their content("hello"). But double free the same memory will be an error.

After copying, `let s2 = s1;`, Rust invalidate `s1`.

![invalidate-variable-after-copy](../assets/invalidate-variable-after-copy.svg)

`s1` can no longer be used and Rust dont need to deal with double free error.

```rust title= showLineNumbers
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

<Admonition type="info" title="info">

The unknow-size value that are copied are called "moved value"

`s1` was moved into `s2`

</Admonition>

## Variables and Data Interacting with Clone

Clone unknown-size variable by `clone` method

```rust title= showLineNumbers
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

will get this:

![cloned variable](../assets/cloned-variable.svg)

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

Calling `clone` on known-size variable are the same as direct assignment. They are stored entirely on the stack.

```rust title= showLineNumbers
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
// same as
let x = 5;
let y = x.clone();

println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
```

</Admonition>

## `Copy` and `Drop` trait

`Copy` trait for (known-size) variable store in stack.

`Drop` trait for (unknown-size) variable store in heap.

If type implement `Copy` trait, variables will not moved but copied instead.

You <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> can not </Color> annotate a type that has implemented `Drop` trait with `Copy` trait

Example of types that implement `Copy`:

- integer
- bool
- float
- char
- tuples (if all type they contain can implement `Copy`)

## Ownership and function

Passing a variable to a function will move or copy (passing ownership), just as assignment does.

```rust title= showLineNumbers
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // value of s moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.
```

return value and scope

```rust title= showLineNumbers
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // highlight-next-line
                                             // moves out to the calling function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by `drop` unless ownership of the data has been moved to <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> another variable </Color>.
