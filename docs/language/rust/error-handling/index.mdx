# Error Handling

Rust groups errors into two major categories:

- **[Recoverable error](recoverable-error):** such as a file not found error, we most likely just want to report the problem to the user and retry the operation.
- **[Unrecoverable errors](unrecoverable-error):** are always symptoms of bugs, like trying to access a location beyond the end of an array

Rust doesnâ€™t have exceptions. 

Instead, it has the type `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors.

And `panic!` macro that stops execution when the program encounters an unrecoverable error.
