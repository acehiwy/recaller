When the handler finishes processing the first event, the runtime sends it another. The function's class stays in memory, so clients and variables that are declared outside of the handler method in initialization code can be reused. To save processing time on subsequent events, create reusable resources like AWS SDK clients during initialization. Once initialized, each instance of your function can process thousands of requests.

Your function also has access to local storage in the /tmp directory. The directory content remains when the execution environment is frozen, providing a transient cache that can be used for multiple invocations. For more information, see Lambda execution environment.
