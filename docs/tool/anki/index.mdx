# Anki

Anki is a <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> program which makes remembering things easy </Color>.

<Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)">

You can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup.

There are two simple concepts behind Anki:

- [Active recall testing](#active-recall-testing)
- [Spaced repetition](#spaced-repetition)

## Active Recall Testing

Active recall testing means being <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> asked a question </Color> and <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> trying to remember the answer </Color>.

This is in contrast to passive study, where we read, watch, or listen to something <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> without pausing to consider if we know the answer </Color>

Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study. There are two reasons for this:

- The act of recalling something strengthens the memory, increasing the chances we'll be able to remember it again.
- When we're unable to answer a question, it tells us we need to return to the material to review or relearn it

A good way to integrate active recall testing into your own studies is to use <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> flashcards </Color>.

With traditional paper flashcards, you write a question on one side of a card, and the answer on the other side.

By not turning the card over until you've thought about the answer, you can learn things more effectively than passive observation allows.

## Spaced Repetition

The spacing effect was reported by a German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885.

He observed that we tend to remember things more effectively, if we spread reviews out over time, instead of studying multiple times in one session.
