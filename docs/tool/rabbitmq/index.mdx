# Rabbitmq

## Introduction

RabbitMQ is a message broker: it <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> accepts and forwards </Color> messages.

<Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)">

You can think about it as a post office: when you put the mail that you want posting
in a post box, you can be sure that the letter carrier will eventually deliver
the mail to your recipient. In this analogy, RabbitMQ is a post box, a post office,
and a letter carrier.

</Color>

RabbitMQ accepts, stores, and forwards binary blobs of data - messages.

## Producer

Producing means nothing more than sending. A program that sends messages is a <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> producer </Color>.

## Queue

A queue is the name for a post box which lives inside RabbitMQ.

Although messages flow through RabbitMQ and your applications,they can only be stored inside a queue.

A queue is only bound by the host's memory & disk limits, it's essentially a large message buffer.

Many producers can send messages that go to one queue, and many consumers can try to receive data from one queue. This is how we represent a queue

## Consumer

Consuming has a similar meaning to receiving. A consumer is a program that mostly waits to receive messages.
