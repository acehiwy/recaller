# Work Queues

In this one we'll create a Work Queue that will be used to distribute time-consuming tasks among multiple workers.

The main idea behind Work Queues (aka: Task Queues) is to avoid doing a resource-intensive task immediately and having to wait for it to complete.

Instead we <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> schedule the task to be done later </Color>.

We encapsulate a task as a message and send it to a queue.

A worker process running in the background will pop the tasks and eventually execute the job.

When you run many workers the tasks will be shared between them.

## Setting up

We will use `setTimeout` for time-consuming task.

We'll take the number of dots in the string representing onr second of work. For example, a fake task described by `Hello...` will take three seconds.

### Producer

We will create `new_task.js` file. This program will schedule tasks to our work queue:

```javascript title=new_task.js showLineNumbers
var amqp = require("amqplib/callback_api");

amqp.connect("amqp://localhost", function (error0, connection) {
  if (error0) {
    throw error0;
  }
  connection.createChannel(function (error1, channel) {
    if (error1) {
      throw error1;
    }

    // highlight-start
    var queue = "task_queue";
    var msg = process.argv.slice(2).join(" ") || "Hello World!";

    channel.assertQueue(queue, {
      durable: true,
    });
    channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from(msg), {
      persistent: true,
    });
    console.log(" [x] Sent '%s'", msg);
    // highlight-end
  });
  setTimeout(function () {
    connection.close();
    process.exit(0);
  }, 500);
});
```

### Consumer

We will create `worker.js` file. it needs to fake a second of work for every dot in the message body.

```javascript title=worker.js showLineNumbers
var amqp = require("amqplib/callback_api");

amqp.connect("amqp://localhost", function (error0, connection) {
  if (error0) {
    throw error0;
  }
  connection.createChannel(function (error1, channel) {
    if (error1) {
      throw error1;
    }
    var queue = "task_queue";

    // This makes sure the queue is declared before attempting to consume from it
    // highlight-start
    channel.assertQueue(queue, {
      durable: true,
    });

    channel.consume(
      queue,
      function (msg) {
        var secs = msg.content.toString().split(".").length - 1;

        console.log(" [x] Received %s", msg.content.toString());
        setTimeout(function () {
          console.log(" [x] Done");
        }, secs * 1000);
      },
      {
        // automatic acknowledgment mode,
        noAck: true,
      }
    );
    // highlight-end
  });
});
```

### Running them

```bash title=shell_1
node worker.js
```

```bash title=shell_2
node new_task.js
```

## Round-robin dispatching

One of the advantages of using a Task Queue is the ability to easily parallelise work.

If we are building up a backlog of work, we can just add more workers and that way, scale easily.

First, let's try to run <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> two </Color> `worker.js` scripts at the same time.

They will both get messages from the queue, but how exactly? Let's see.

You need three shells open. Two will run the `worker.js` script.

```bash title=shell_1
node worker.js
```

```bash title=shell_2
node new_task.js
```

In the third shell one we'll publish new tasks.

```bash title=shell_2
node new_task.js First message.
node new_task.js Second message..
node new_task.js Third message...
node new_task.js Fourth message....
node new_task.js Fifth message.....
```

Let's see what is delivered to our workers:

```text title=shell_1 showLineNumbers
=> [x] Received 'First message.'
=> [x] Received 'Third message...'
=> [x] Received 'Fifth message.....'
```

```text title=shell_2 showLineNumbers
=> [x] Received 'Second message..'
=> [x] Received 'Fourth message....'
```

By default, RabbitMQ will <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> send each message </Color> to the <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> next </Color> <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> consumer </Color>,<Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> in sequence </Color>.

On average every consumer will get the <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> same number </Color> of messages. This way of distributing messages is called round-robin.

## Message acknowledgment

Doing a task can take a few seconds. You may wonder what happens if one of the consumers starts a long task and dies with it only partly done.

With our current code, once RabbitMQ delivers a message to the consumer it immediately marks it for deletion.

In this case, if you kill a worker we will lose the message it was just processing.

We'll also <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> lose all the messages that were dispatched </Color> to this particular worker <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> but were not yet handled </Color>.

In order to make sure a message is never lost, RabbitMQ supports [message acknowledgments](../message-acknowledgment).

An ack(nowledgement) is <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> sent back </Color> <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> by the consumer </Color> to tell RabbitMQ that a particular message has been received, processed and that RabbitMQ is <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> free to delete the message </Color>.

If a consumer dies without sending an ack, RabbitMQ will understand that a message wasn't processed fully and will <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> re-queue </Color> it.

A timeout (30 minutes by default) is enforced on <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> consumer </Color> <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> delivery </Color> <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> acknowledgement </Color>.
This helps detect buggy (stuck) consumers that never acknowledge deliveries. You can increase this timeout as described in [Delivery Acknowledgement Timeout](https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html#acknowledgement-timeout).

Manual consumer acknowledgments have been turned off in previous examples.
It's time to turn them on using the `{noAck: false}` option and send a proper acknowledgment from the worker, once we're done with a task.

```javascript title=worker.js showLineNumbers
var amqp = require("amqplib/callback_api");

amqp.connect("amqp://localhost", function (error0, connection) {
  if (error0) {
    throw error0;
  }
  connection.createChannel(function (error1, channel) {
    if (error1) {
      throw error1;
    }
    var queue = "task_queue";

    // This makes sure the queue is declared before attempting to consume from it
    channel.assertQueue(queue, {
      durable: true,
    });

    // highlight-start
    channel.consume(
      queue,
      function (msg) {
        var secs = msg.content.toString().split(".").length - 1;

        console.log(" [x] Received %s", msg.content.toString());
        setTimeout(function () {
          console.log(" [x] Done");
          channel.ack(msg);
        }, secs * 1000);
      },
      {
        // manual acknowledgment mode,
        noAck: false,
      }
    );
    // highlight-end
  });
});
```

<Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)">

Using this code we can be sure that even if you kill a worker using CTRL+C while it was processing a message, nothing will be lost.

</Color>

<Admonition type="caution" title="caution">

Acknowledgement <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> must be sent </Color> on the <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> same channel </Color> <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> that received the delivery </Color>.

Attempts to acknowledge using a different channel will result in a channel-level protocol exception.

See the [doc guide on confirmations](https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html) to learn more.

</Admonition>

### Forgotten acknowledgment

It's a common mistake to miss the ack. It's an easy error, but the consequences are serious.

RabbitMQ will eat more and more memory as it won't be able to release any unacked messages.

In order to debug this kind of mistake you can use `rabbitmqctl` to print the `messages_unacknowledged` field:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="linux">

```bash title=
sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="windows">

```bash title=
rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Message durability

When RabbitMQ quits or crashes it will forget the queues and messages unless you tell it not to.

Two things are required to make sure that messages aren't lost:

- [durable queue](#durable-queue) (queue won't be lose when RabbitMQ restart)
- [message persistence](#message-persistence) (message won't be lose when RabbitMQ restart)

### Durable queue

First, we need to make sure that the <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> queue </Color> will <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> survive </Color> a RabbitMQ <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> node restart </Color>.

In order to do so, we need to declare it as durable:

```javascript title=
channel.assertQueue("hello", { durable: true });
```

Although this command is correct by itself, it won't work in our present setup. That's because we've already defined a queue called hello which is not durable.

&#8203;<Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)">RabbitMQ doesn't allow you to redefine an</Color> <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)">existing queue with different parameters</Color>
and will return an error to any program that tries to do that.

But there is a quick workaround - let's declare a queue with different name, for example `task_queue`:

```javascript title=
channel.assertQueue("task_queue", { durable: true });
```

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

This `durable` <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> option change needs to be applied </Color> to <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> both </Color> <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> the producer and consumer </Color> code.

</Admonition>

### Message persistence

At this point we're sure that the `task_queue` queue won't be lost even if RabbitMQ restarts.

Now we need to mark our messages as persistent - by using the `persistent` option `Channel.sendToQueue` takes.

```javascript title=producer.js
channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from(msg), { persistent: true });
```

<Admonition type="caution" title="caution">

Marking messages as persistent doesn't fully guarantee that a message won't be lost.

Although <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> it tells RabbitMQ to save the message to disk </Color>,
there is still a short time window when RabbitMQ has accepted a message and hasn't saved it yet.

Also, RabbitMQ doesn't do `fsync(2)` for every message -- it may be just saved to cache and not really written to the disk.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="info">

The persistence guarantees aren't strong, but it's more than enough for our simple task queue. If you need a stronger guarantee then you can use [publisher confirms](https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html).

</Admonition>

## Fair dispatch

In a situation with two workers, when all odd messages are heavy and even messages are light,
one worker will be constantly busy and the other one will do hardly any work.

RabbitMQ doesn't know anything about that and will still dispatch messages evenly.

This happens because RabbitMQ just dispatches a message when the message enters the queue. It doesn't look at the number of unacknowledged messages for a consumer.

It just blindly dispatches every n-th message to the n-th consumer.

In order to defeat that we can use the `prefetch` method with the value of `1`. This tells RabbitMQ <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> not to give more than one message to a worker at a time </Color>.
In other words, don't dispatch a new message to a worker until it has processed and acknowledged the previous one.

Instead, it will dispatch it to the next worker that is not still busy.

```javascript title=consumer.js
channel.prefetch(1);
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="tip">

If all the workers are busy, <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> your queue can fill up </Color>.

You will want to keep an eye on that, and maybe add more workers, or have some other strategy.

</Admonition>
