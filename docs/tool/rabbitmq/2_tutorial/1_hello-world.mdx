# Hello World

In this part of the tutorial we'll write two small programs in Javascript;
a producer that sends a single message, and a consumer that receives messages and prints them out.

We'll gloss over some of the detail in the [amqp.node](https://amqp-node.github.io/amqplib/) API.

In the diagram below:

- "P" is our producer
- "C" is our consumer.
- The box in the middle is a queue - a message buffer that RabbitMQ keeps on behalf of the consumer.

RabbitMQ speaks multiple protocols. This tutorial uses AMQP 0-9-1, which is an open, general-purpose protocol for messaging.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="later">

RabbitMQ clients are available in [many different languages](http://rabbitmq.com/devtools.html).

</Admonition>

here we will use [amqp.node](https://amqp-node.github.io/amqplib/):

```bash title=
npm install amqplib
```

## Sending message

![Sending Message](../assets/sending-message.png)

We'll call our message publisher (sender) `send.js` and our message consumer (receiver) `receive.js`.

The publisher will connect to RabbitMQ, send a single message, then exit.

In `send.js`, we need to require the library first:

```javascript title=send.js showLineNumbers
var amqp = require("amqplib/callback_api");
```

then connect to RabbitMQ server:

```javascript title=send.js showLineNumbers
var amqp = require("amqplib/callback_api");

// highlight-next-line
amqp.connect("amqp://localhost", function (error0, connection) {});
```

Next we create a channel, which is where most of the API for getting things done resides:

```javascript title=send.js showLineNumbers
var amqp = require("amqplib/callback_api");

amqp.connect("amqp://localhost", function (error0, connection) {
  if (error0) {
    throw error0;
  }
  // highlight-next-line
  connection.createChannel(function (error1, channel) {});
});
```

To send, we must declare a queue for us to send to; then we can publish a message to the queue:

```javascript title=send.js showLineNumbers
var amqp = require("amqplib/callback_api");

amqp.connect("amqp://localhost", function (error0, connection) {
  if (error0) {
    throw error0;
  }
  connection.createChannel(function (error1, channel) {
    if (error1) {
      throw error1;
    }
    // highlight-start
    var queue = "hello";
    var msg = "Hello world";

    channel.assertQueue(queue, {
      durable: false,
    });

    channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from(msg)); // message content is byte array
    // highlight-end
    console.log(" [x] Sent %s", msg);
  });
});
```

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

Declaring a queue is idempotent - it will only be created if it doesn't exist already.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

The message content is a byte array, so you can encode whatever you like there.

</Admonition>

Lastly, we close the connection and exit:

```javascript title=
var amqp = require("amqplib/callback_api");

amqp.connect("amqp://localhost", function (error0, connection) {
  if (error0) {
    throw error0;
  }
  connection.createChannel(function (error1, channel) {
    if (error1) {
      throw error1;
    }

    var queue = "hello";
    var msg = "Hello World!";

    channel.assertQueue(queue, {
      durable: false,
    });
    channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from(msg));

    console.log(" [x] Sent %s", msg);
  });

  // highlight-start
  setTimeout(function () {
    connection.close();
    process.exit(0);
  }, 500);
  // highlight-end
});
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="later">

Sending doesn't work!

If this is your first time using RabbitMQ and you don't see the "Sent" message then you may be left scratching your head wondering what could be wrong.

Maybe the broker was started <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> without enough free disk space </Color> (by default it needs at least 200 MB free) and is therefore refusing to accept messages.

Check the broker logfile to confirm and reduce the limit if necessary.

The [configuration file documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html#config-items) will show you how to set `disk_free_limit`.

</Admonition>

## Consuming message

Unlike the publisher which publishes a single message, we'll <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> keep the consumer running </Color> to listen for messages and print them out.

Setting up is the same as the publisher; we open a connection and a channel, and declare the queue from which we're going to consume.

Note this matches up with the queue that `sendToQueue` publishes to.

```javascript title=receive.js showLineNumbers
var amqp = require("amqplib/callback_api");

amqp.connect("amqp://localhost", function (error0, connection) {
  if (error0) {
    throw error0;
  }
  connection.createChannel(function (error1, channel) {
    if (error1) {
      throw error1;
    }
    var queue = "hello";

    // highlight-start
    channel.assertQueue(queue, {
      durable: false,
    });
    // highlight-end
  });
});
```

We <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> declare the queue here, as well </Color>. Because we might start the consumer before the publisher,
we want to make sure the queue exists before we try to consume messages from it.

We're about to tell the server to deliver us the messages from the queue.

Since it will <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> push </Color> us messages asynchronously,
we provide a callback that will be executed when RabbitMQ pushes messages to our consumer.

This is what `Channel.consume` does.

```javascript title=receive.js showLineNumbers
var amqp = require("amqplib/callback_api");

amqp.connect("amqp://localhost", function (error0, connection) {
  if (error0) {
    throw error0;
  }
  connection.createChannel(function (error1, channel) {
    if (error1) {
      throw error1;
    }

    var queue = "hello";

    channel.assertQueue(queue, {
      durable: false,
    });

    // highlight-start
    console.log(" [*] Waiting for messages in %s. To exit press CTRL+C", queue);

    channel.consume(
      queue,
      function (msg) {
        console.log(" [x] Received %s", msg.content.toString());
      },
      {
        noAck: true,
      }
    );
    // highlight-end
  });
});
```

## Putting it all together

Now we can run both scripts.

```bash title=
node send.js
```

```bash title=
node receive.js
```

<Admonition type="info" title="info">

You may wish to see what queues RabbitMQ has and how many messages are in them. You can do it (as a privileged user) using the `rabbitmqctl` tool:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="linux">

```bash title=
sudo rabbitmqctl.bat list_queues
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="window" label="window">

```bash title=
rabbitmqctl.bat list_queues
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
