# Swizzling

## Overview

This section is similar to [Styling and Layout](styling-and-layout), but this time, we will write actual React code instead of playing with stylesheets.

In practice, swizzling allows to swap a theme component with your own implementation, and it comes in 2 patterns:

- [Ejecting](#ejecting): creates a <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> copy </Color> of the original theme component, which you can <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> fully customize </Color>
- [Wrapping](#wrapping): creates a <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> wrapper </Color> around the original theme component, which you can <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> enhance </Color>

<Admonition type="tip" title="tip">

Prefer [wrapping](#wrapping) whenever possible: the amount of code to maintain is smaller.

</Admonition>

### <Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)"> Why is it called swizzling? </Color>

The name comes from Objective-C and Swift-UI: method swizzling is the process of changing the implementation of an existing selector (method).

For Docusaurus, component swizzling means providing an alternative component that takes precedence over the component provided by the theme.

You can think of it as [Monkey Patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) for React components, enabling you to override the default implementation.
Gatsby has a similar concept called [theme shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/).

<Admonition type="tip" title="tip">

To gain a deeper understanding of this, you have to understand [how theme components are resolved](https://docusaurus.io/docs/advanced/client#theme-aliases).

</Admonition>

## Swizzling Process

Docusaurus provides an convenient interactive CLI to swizzle components.

You generally only need to remember the following command:

```bash title=
docusaurus swizzle
```

It will <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> generate a new component </Color> your `src/theme` directory,
which should look like this example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Ejecting" label="Ejecting">

```jsx title=src/theme/Footer/index.js showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import { useThemeConfig } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";
import FooterLinks from "@theme/Footer/Links";
import FooterLogo from "@theme/Footer/Logo";
import FooterCopyright from "@theme/Footer/Copyright";
import FooterLayout from "@theme/Footer/Layout";

function Footer() {
  const { footer } = useThemeConfig();
  if (!footer) {
    return null;
  }
  const { copyright, links, logo, style } = footer;
  return (
    <FooterLayout
      style={style}
      links={links && links.length > 0 && <FooterLinks links={links} />}
      logo={logo && <FooterLogo logo={logo} />}
      copyright={copyright && <FooterCopyright copyright={copyright} />}
    />
  );
}
export default React.memo(Footer);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Wrapping" label="Wrapping">

```jsx title=src/theme/SomeComponent.js showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import Footer from "@theme-original/Footer";

export default function FooterWrapper(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <Footer {...props} />
    </>
  );
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="tip" title="later" icon="">

To get an overview of all the themes and components available to swizzle, run:

```bash title=
docusaurus swizzle --list
```

Use `--help` to see all available CLI options, or refer to the reference [swizzle CLI documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/cli#docusaurus-swizzle).

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

After swizzling a component, restart your dev server in order for Docusaurus to know about the new component.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

`docusaurus swizzle` is only an automated way to help you swizzle the component.

You can also create the `src/theme/SomeComponent.js` file <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> manually </Color>,
and Docusaurus will [resolve it](https://docusaurus.io/docs/advanced/client#theme-aliases).

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="danger" title="danger">

Be sure to understand which components are [safe to swizzle](#what-is-safe-to-swizzle). Some components are internal implementation details of a theme.

</Admonition>

### Ejecting

Ejecting a theme component is the process of <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> creating a copy </Color> of the original theme component,
which you can fully customize and override.

To eject a theme component, use the swizzle CLI interactively, or with the '--eject' option:

```bash title=
docusaurus swizzle [theme name] [component name] --eject
```

Example:

```bash title=
docusaurus swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer --eject
```

This will copy the current `<Footer />` component's implementation to your site's `src/theme` directory.

Docusaurus will now use this `<Footer>` component copy <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> instead of the original one </Color>.

<Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)">

You are now free to completely re-implement the `<Footer>` component.

</Color>

```jsx title=src/theme/SomeComponent.js showLineNumbers
import React from "react";

export default function Footer(props) {
  return (
    <footer>
      <h1>This is my custom site footer</h1>
      <p>And it is very different from the original</p>
    </footer>
  );
}
```

<Admonition type="caution" title="caution">

Ejecting an [unsafe](#what-is-safe-to-swizzle) component can sometimes lead to copying a large amount of internal code, which <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> you now have to maintain yourself </Color>.

It can make Docusaurus upgrades more difficult, as you will need to migrate your customizations if the props received or internal theme APIs used have changed.

</Admonition>

#### <Color color="var(--not-nesary-for-now-future-font-color)"> Re-Swizzling </Color>

To keep ejected components up-to-date after a Docusaurus upgrade, re-run the `eject` command and compare the changes with `git diff`.

<Admonition type="tip" title="tip">

You are also recommended to write a brief comment at the top of the file explaining what changes you have made,
so that you could more easily re-apply your changes after re-ejection.

</Admonition>

### Wrapping

Wrapping a theme component is the process of <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> creating a wrapper around </Color> the <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> original theme component </Color>,
which you can <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> enhance </Color>.

To wrap a theme component, use the swizzle CLI interactively, or with the `--wrap` option:

```bash title=
docusaurus swizzle [theme name] [component name] --wrap
```

Example:

```bash title=
docusaurus swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer --wrap
```

This will create a wrapper in your site's `src/theme` directory.

Docusaurus will now use the `<FooterWrapper>` component <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> instead </Color> of the <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> original one </Color>.

You can now add customizations around the original component.

```jsx title=src/theme/SomeComponent.js showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
// highlight-next-line
import Footer from "@theme-original/Footer";

export default function FooterWrapper(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <section>
        <h2>Extra section</h2>
        <p>This is an extra section that appears above the original footer</p>
      </section>
      <Footer {...props} />
    </>
  );
}
```

<details>

<summary>
  <Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)">
    What is this @theme-original thing?
  </Color>
</summary>

Docusaurus uses [theme aliases](https://docusaurus.io/docs/advanced/client#theme-aliases) to resolve the theme components to use.

The newly created wrapper <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> takes </Color> the `@theme/SomeComponent` <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> alias </Color>.

`@theme-original/SomeComponent` allows to import original component that the wrapper shadows without creating an infinite import loop where the wrapper imports itself.

</details>

<Admonition type="tip" title="tip">

Wrapping a theme is a great way to <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> add extra components around </Color> <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> existing one </Color> without [ejecting](#ejecting) it.

For example, you can easily add a custom comment system under each blog post:

```jsx title=src/theme/BlogPostItem.js showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import BlogPostItem from "@theme-original/BlogPostItem";
import MyCustomCommentSystem from "@site/src/MyCustomCommentSystem";

export default function BlogPostItemWrapper(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <BlogPostItem {...props} />
      <MyCustomCommentSystem />
    </>
  );
}
```

</Admonition>

## What is safe to swizzle?

Some theme components are <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> internal implementation details </Color> of a theme.

Docusaurus allows you to swizzle them, but it might be <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> risky </Color>. (breaking change / backward-<Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> incompatibility </Color> when theme authors updating their theme).

For each theme component, the swizzle CLI will indicate 3 different <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> levels of safety </Color> declared by theme authors:

- **Safe**: this component is <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> safe to be swizzled </Color>, its public API is considered <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> stable </Color>,
  and no breaking changes should happen within a theme <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> major </Color> <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> version </Color>
- **Unsafe**: this component is a theme implementation detail, <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> not safe </Color> <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> to be swizzled </Color>,
  and <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> breaking changes </Color> might happen within a theme <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> minor </Color> <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> version </Color>
- **Forbidden**: the swizzle CLI will <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> prevent </Color> you from swizzling this component, because it is <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> not designed to be swizzled at all </Color>

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

Some components might be safe to wrap, but not safe to eject.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="info">

Don't be too afraid to swizzle unsafe components: just keep in mind that breaking changes might happen, and you might need to upgrade your customizations manually on minor version upgrades.

</Admonition>

---

### <Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)"> Why is it risky? </Color>

Theme authors might have to update their theme over time: changing the component props, name, file system location, types...

For example, consider a component that receives two props `name` and `age`, but after a refactor,
it now receives a `person` prop with the above two properties.
Your component, which still expects these two props, will render `undefined` instead.

Moreover, internal components may simply disappear.
If a component is called `Sidebar` and it's later renamed to `DocSidebar`, your swizzled component will be <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> completely ignored </Color>.

Theme components <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> marked as unsafe </Color> may change in a backward-<Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> incompatible </Color> way between theme minor versions.

When upgrading a theme (or Docusaurus), your customizations might behave unexpectedly, and can even break your site.

---

## <Color color="var(--not-nesary-for-now-future-font-color)"> Which component should I swizzle? </Color>

It is not always clear which component you should swizzle exactly to achieve the desired result.

`@docusaurus/theme-classic`, which provides most of the theme components, has about [100 components](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/docusaurus-theme-classic/src/theme)!

To print an overview of all the `@docusaurus/theme-classic` components:

```bash title=
docusaurus swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic --list
```

You can follow these steps to <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> locate </Color> the <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> appropriate component to swizzle </Color>:

1. Component description. Some components provide a short description, which is a good way to find the right one.
1. Component name. Official theme components are semantically named, so you should be able to infer its function from the name.
   - For example, if you run yarn swizzle `@docusaurus/theme-classic`, and enter `Doc`, only the docs-related components will be listed.
     The swizzle CLI allows you to enter part of a component name to narrow down the available choices.
1. Start with a higher-level component. Components form a tree with some components importing others. Every route will be associated with one top-level component that the route will render (most of them listed in Routing in content plugins). For example, all blog post pages have @theme/BlogPostPage as the topmost component. You can start with swizzling this component, and then go down the component tree to locate the component that renders just what you are targeting. Don't forget to unswizzle the rest by deleting the files after you've found the correct one, so you don't maintain too many components.
1. Read the theme [source code](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/docusaurus-theme-classic/src/theme) and use search wisely.

## Wrapping your site with `<Root>`

The `<Root>` component is <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> rendered </Color> at the <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> very top of the React tree </Color>, above the theme `<Layout>`, and <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> never unmounts </Color>.

It is the <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> perfect place to add stateful logic </Color> that <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> should not be re-initialized </Color> across navigations (user authentication status, shopping card state...).

Swizzle it manually by creating a file at `src/theme/Root.js`:

```jsx title=src/theme/Root.js showLineNumbers
import React from "react";

// Default implementation, that you can customize
export default function Root({ children }) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}
```
