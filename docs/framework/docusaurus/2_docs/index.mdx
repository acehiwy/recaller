# Docs

The docs feature provides users with a way to organize Markdown files in a hierarchical format.

Your site's documentation is organized by four levels, from lowest to highest:

1. Individual pages.
1. Sidebars.
1. Versions.
1. Plugin instances.

## Docs-only mode

A freshly initialized Docusaurus site has the following structure:

```title= showLineNumbers
example.com/                                -> generated from `src/pages/index.js`

example.com/docs/intro                      -> generated from `docs/intro.md`
example.com/docs/tutorial-basics/...        -> generated from `docs/tutorial-basics/...`

example.com/blog/2021/08/26/welcome         -> generated from `blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md`
example.com/blog/2021/08/01/mdx-blog-post   -> generated from `blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx`
```

All docs will be served under the subroute `docs/`.

But what if your site only has docs, or you want to prioritize your docs by putting them at the root?

To enter docs-only mode, change it to like this:

```javascript title=docusaurus.config.js showLineNumbers
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    "@docusaurus/preset-classic",
    {
      docs: {
        // highlight-next-line
        routeBasePath: "/", // Serve the docs at the site's root
        /* other docs plugin options */
      },
      // highlight-next-line
      blog: false, // Optional: disable the blog plugin
      // ...
    },
  ],
};
```

All that routeBasePath: '/' does is that instead of serving the docs through `https://example.com/docs/some-doc`,
they are now at the site root: `https://example.com/some-doc`.

:::note

Don't forget to put some page at the root (https://example.com/) through adding the front matter:

```markdown title=docs/index.md showLineNumbers
---
slug: /
---

This page will be the home page when users visit https://example.com/.
```

:::

:::caution

If you added slug: / to a doc to make it the homepage, you should delete the existing homepage at `./src/pages/index.js`, or else there will be two files mapping to the same route!

:::

Now, the site's structure will be like the following:

```title= showLineNumbers
example.com/                       -> generated from `docs/intro.md`
example.com/tutorial-basics/...    -> generated from `docs/tutorial-basics/...`
```

:::tip Docs config API reference
