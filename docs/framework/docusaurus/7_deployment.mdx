# Deployment

To build the static files of your website for production, run:

```bash title=
docusaurus build
```

Once it finishes, the static files will be generated within the build directory.

## Configuration

The following parameters are required in docusaurus.config.js to optimize routing and serve files from the correct location:

| Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`     | URL for your site. For a site deployed at `https://my-org.com/my-project/`, `url` is `https://my-org.com/`.                                                                                                     |
| `baseUrl` | Base URL for your project, <Color color='var(--secondary-font-color)'> with a trailing slash </Color>. For a site deployed at `https://my-org.com/my-project/`, `baseUrl` is `/my-project/`. `/` if no pathname |

## Testing your build locally

```bash title=
docusaurus serve
```

By default, this will load your site at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## Trailing slash configuration

Docusaurus has a [trailingSlash config](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/docusaurus-config#trailingSlash),
to allow customizing URLs/links and emitted filename patterns.

The default value generally works fine. Unfortunately, <Color color='var(--secondary-font-color)'> each static hosting provider </Color> has a <Color color='var(--secondary-font-color)'> different behavior </Color>,
and deploying the exact same site to various hosts can lead to distinct results.

Depending on your host, it can be useful to change this config.
