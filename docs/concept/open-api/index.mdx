# OpenAPI

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a vendor neutral description format for HTTP-based remote APIs
The OpenAPI Specification allows the description of a remote API accessible through HTTP or HTTP-like protocols.

OpenAPI can describe APIs based on the HTTP protocol (like RESTful ones) but also APIs based on HTTP-like protocols like CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) or WebSockets. This allows OpenAPI to be used in resource-restricted scenarios like IoT (Internet of Things)

errors in the usage of an API defined through its documentation cannot be discovered until runtime,
